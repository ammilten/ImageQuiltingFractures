# ImageQuiltingFractures

This repository contains code and functions used to analyze the effectiveness 
of image quilting for simulating fracture networks conditioned on geophysial data.

The two notebooks are very similar and contain the code used in the analysis. The file "IQFrac_original.ipynb" 
contains the code used to generate the data and plot some figures. The file "IQFrac_noSims.ipynb" 
contains code that loads the data from those original simulations and plots a few different figures. 

The libary ImageQuiltingHelpers.jl just contains some helper functions used in the code. You can examine them
if you want to get a more in-depth idea of how the code in the notebooks works.
